# Hosted Passwordless Access

## Status

Approved

## Outcome

A user who does not use GitHub can choose hosted project-data storage, verify an email address through a passwordless magic link, and securely create or restore hosted workspace access without managing a password.

## Users

- BA, PO, and PM users who need hosted projects or later collaboration without a GitHub account.
- Developers and contributors using local repositories with hosted SDD project data.

## Primary Workflow

1. A user enters through `Work without GitHub` and selects hosted project-data storage.
2. The product identifies the verified email as the access method and explains that losing access to it is not recoverable in the first release unless another sign-in method was linked beforehand.
3. The product requests an email address and returns an account-neutral acknowledgement.
4. The product sends a short-lived, single-use magic link bound to the current authentication attempt.
5. The user opens the valid link before expiry.
6. The product verifies the email, consumes the link once, and establishes a protected hosted session.
7. The product creates or restores the stable hosted identity and personal workspace.
8. Authorized hosted projects are shown alongside on-device projects available to the current device without uploading or reassigning them.

## In Scope

- Verified email as the non-GitHub hosted identity.
- Passwordless magic-link request, delivery, verification, consumption, resend, abuse protection, and recovery boundaries.
- Hosted session creation, restoration, expiry, revocation, and sign-out.
- Persistent independent device sessions and user-controlled session revocation.
- Stable hosted identity and personal workspace creation or restoration.
- Account-enumeration resistance.
- First-release lost-email access and recovery boundary.
- Combined presentation of authorized hosted and locally available on-device projects without implicit migration.
- GDPR data contracts for email, authentication events, sessions, delivery processors, logs, support, and security data.

## Out of Scope

- GitHub sign-in and repository discovery, defined in `specs/01-github-project-onboarding/`.
- Local worker and repository validation, defined in `specs/02-local-project-onboarding/`.
- GitHub and passwordless identity merging, defined in `specs/04-github-identity-linking/`.
- Storage migration, retention, and resynchronization, defined in `specs/05-project-storage-lifecycle/`.
- Password-based accounts.
- Verified-email change UI and recovery beyond a sign-in method linked before email access was lost.
- Collaboration invitations, memberships, roles, or permissions.
- Shared-device isolation beyond the current operating-system boundary.

## Business Rules

- Hosted storage must establish an authorized identity before hosted project data is created or exposed.
- The non-GitHub hosted path uses a verified email and must not require or store a password.
- A magic link must be short-lived, single-use, bound to the intended authentication attempt, and invalid after successful use.
- Magic-link tokens and equivalent secrets must not appear in persisted application data beyond the approved protected representation, client-visible payloads, analytics, or logs.
- Requesting a magic link must return the same user-facing response whether or not the email already has an account.
- Invalid, expired, used, replayed, or mismatched links must not establish a session or expose whether an account exists.
- Resend behavior must not leave multiple uncontrolled valid links; the approved invalidation rule must be enforced.
- Delivery and verification endpoints require approved rate limits and abuse controls without creating account-enumeration signals.
- A successful verification creates or restores one stable hosted identity and personal workspace for the verified email under the approved identity rules.
- The first hosted-access slice must identify the verified email as the access method and must not promise recovery that the release does not support.
- If the user loses access to the verified email, another sign-in method linked to the same hosted identity before the loss may still restore access to that identity and workspace.
- If no other sign-in method was linked before email access was lost, the first release provides no self-service or support override that bypasses proof of an existing sign-in method.
- Access through an already linked sign-in method must not replace or change the verified email.
- Changing the verified email requires fresh proof through the current verified email and verification of the new email. An existing session or another linked sign-in method alone is insufficient.
- The verified-email change interface is deferred beyond the first hosted-access slice.
- Hosted sessions must be protected, revocable, and unavailable to coding-agent processes unless a later specification grants a narrow capability.
- A hosted session must remain valid across browser restarts until the user signs out, the session is revoked, or it reaches its approved security expiration.
- The same hosted identity may have independent active sessions on multiple devices.
- Normal sign-out must revoke only the current device session.
- Account settings must show active device sessions and allow the user to revoke one session or all sessions.
- Revoking one session must not end other active sessions. `Sign out all devices` must revoke every active session for the hosted identity.
- Exact expiration periods, renewal mechanics, device-identification fields, and presentation details are technical and privacy decisions constrained by this behavior.
- Signing out removes access to hosted projects from the affected client without deleting or hiding on-device projects.
- On-device projects remain available under the device boundary after authentication and sign-out; authentication must not upload, synchronize, duplicate, reassign, or change their storage mode.
- A combined catalog must identify each project's storage mode and current availability.
- Different stable projects must remain separate catalog entries even when they link to the same repository. A shared repository alone must not merge or deduplicate them.
- One stable project that has been explicitly migrated or resynchronized must appear once with its authoritative storage mode.
- Combined-catalog presentation must not automatically merge projects, link identities, upload data, synchronize data, or change a project's storage mode.
- The verified email, authentication events, delivery records, sessions, and security logs are personal data with approved purposes, lawful bases, access, retention, deletion, rights behavior, processors, transfers, and required review.
- Analytics may retain only aggregate genuinely anonymous metrics; email hashes, stable pseudonyms, IP addresses, and linkable delivery or session identifiers are personal data, not anonymous analytics.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Given a non-GitHub user selects hosted storage, when they continue, then email verification is required before hosted data is created or exposed.
- Given any email is submitted, when the request is acknowledged, then the response does not reveal whether an account exists.
- Given a valid unused magic link for the current attempt, when it is opened before expiry, then the email is verified and a protected hosted session is established without a password.
- Given a link is invalid, expired, already used, replayed, or bound to another attempt, when it is opened, then no session or hosted access is created and the response remains account-neutral.
- Given resend is requested, when a new link is issued, then the approved invalidation and rate-limit rules prevent uncontrolled concurrent credentials.
- Given verification succeeds for an existing identity, when the session starts, then the same stable hosted workspace and projects are restored.
- Given verification succeeds for a new identity, when workspace creation completes, then exactly one stable hosted workspace exists.
- Given hosted setup begins, when the access method is explained, then the user is told that losing the verified email is not recoverable in the first release unless another sign-in method was linked beforehand.
- Given the user loses access to the verified email and another sign-in method was linked beforehand, when that method authenticates successfully, then the same hosted identity and workspace are restored without changing the verified email.
- Given the user loses access to the verified email and no other sign-in method was linked beforehand, when recovery is requested, then no self-service or support override grants access.
- Given only an existing session or another linked sign-in method is proven, when a verified-email change is attempted, then the email remains unchanged.
- Given the future verified-email change flow is used, when both the current email is freshly proven and the new email is verified, then the change may continue under its approved implementation contract.
- Given a valid hosted session exists, when its browser restarts, then the same session restores hosted access without another magic link unless it was signed out, revoked, or expired.
- Given the same hosted identity signs in on another device, when the new session starts, then both device sessions remain independently valid.
- Given the user signs out normally, when another device session is checked, then only the session that signed out is revoked.
- Given account settings shows active device sessions, when the user revokes one session, then that session loses hosted access and the other sessions remain valid.
- Given the user selects `Sign out all devices`, when revocation completes, then every active hosted session for that identity loses access.
- Given a session is revoked or expired, when it requests protected hosted data, then access is denied without affecting on-device projects available under the current operating-system boundary.
- Given a signed-in user has on-device projects on the current device, when the catalog loads, then those projects appear with hosted projects without upload, reassignment, duplication, or storage-mode change.
- Given distinct on-device and hosted projects link to the same repository, when the combined catalog loads, then both remain separate entries with their own storage mode and current availability.
- Given one stable project has been explicitly migrated or resynchronized, when the combined catalog loads, then it appears once with its authoritative storage mode.
- Given catalog entries refer to the same repository, when the catalog is composed, then no project merge, identity link, upload, synchronization, or storage-mode change occurs automatically.
- Given the user signs out, when protected views are revisited, then hosted projects require authentication while on-device projects remain available under the local OS boundary.
- Given a token, delivery, session, or provider failure occurs, when the flow ends, then no secret is exposed and no partial identity or workspace is created.
