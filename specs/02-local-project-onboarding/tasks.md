# Local Project Onboarding Tasks

## Status

Blocked

## Active Slice

Deliver accountless on-device onboarding for one local Git repository through one paired macOS worker, ending on the new project's dashboard with its repository, storage mode, and connection status visible without source upload.

## Implementation Boundary

Included:

- Accountless device workspace required by the local path.
- macOS worker discovery, graphical installation guidance, secure pairing, replacement pairing, and status.
- Native folder selection, local Git repository validation, and moved-repository recovery.
- First-connection privacy disclosure, approved minimum metadata exchange, and atomic project registration.
- Accountless data-loss warning and export-only project-history recovery boundary.
- Direct handoff to the new project's dashboard with repository, storage, and connection state.
- Shared naming and repository-uniqueness rules.
- Connection-state and failure UX.
- Privacy and security proof for device metadata and pairing credentials.

Excluded:

- Hosted storage and passwordless authentication.
- Remote or cloud workers and agent execution.
- Source upload, browsing, editing, or execution from the control plane.
- Shared-operating-system-user isolation.
- Windows and Linux worker delivery and verification.

Deferred after this slice:

- Hosted local-repository projects through `specs/03-hosted-passwordless-access/` and `specs/05-project-storage-lifecycle/`.
- Combined catalog implementation that preserves separate project identities and shows one authoritative entry after explicit migration or resynchronization.
- Windows worker support, followed by Linux worker support.

Release boundary:

- This slice may be implemented and verified independently.
- The first usable release remains blocked until `specs/01-github-project-onboarding/` and every shared dependency invoked by both onboarding paths also pass their release gates.
- Coordinated browser proof must show that `Work without GitHub` and `Login with GitHub` are both available and complete from the same entry surface.

## Tasks

- [ ] Establish the accountless device-workspace boundary.
  - Purpose: Persist local project ownership without requiring an account.
  - Proof: Tests show stable access under the same OS boundary, isolation from hosted authorization, and a clear loss outcome that never presents repository reconnection as restoration of missing project history.

- [ ] Implement worker discovery and installation guidance.
  - Purpose: Give non-technical users an actionable path when no worker is available.
  - Proof: macOS browser scenarios cover detected, missing, incompatible, and unavailable worker states plus graphical installation without terminal commands.

- [ ] Implement secure workspace-bound pairing.
  - Purpose: Authorize one worker for one workspace without transferable credentials.
  - Proof: Security tests cover attempt expiry, confirmation, replay rejection, revocation, rotation, replacement-worker pairing, and cross-workspace denial.

- [ ] Implement local repository selection and validation.
  - Purpose: Validate one user-selected Git repository entirely on the worker.
  - Proof: Integration and UI tests cover native folder selection, valid, invalid, inaccessible, moved, non-matching, and unavailable repositories plus canonical-identity reconnection without source upload.

- [ ] Define and enforce minimum outbound metadata.
  - Purpose: Establish connection and compatibility state without sending local paths, remote URLs, filenames, Git history, or source code during onboarding.
  - Proof: Contract and privacy tests reject prohibited fields and any outbound onboarding exchange before first-use confirmation, while allowing later unchanged connections without repeated confirmation.

- [ ] Create the project and local repository connection atomically.
  - Purpose: Apply shared naming and uniqueness rules without partial records.
  - Proof: Tests cover concurrency, duplicate identity, suffix allocation, rollback, and unchanged repository state.

- [ ] Build local onboarding and connection-state UX.
  - Purpose: Complete the path without requiring terminal interaction beyond any approved installer step.
  - Proof: Desktop and mobile scenarios cover graphical installation, pairing, native selection, first-connection disclosure and confirmation, accessible later disclosure, data-loss warning, success, direct new-project dashboard routing, visible repository, storage mode, connection status, replacement-worker pairing, `Locate repository` recovery, and project-portability handoff when an export exists.

## Verification Gate

- [ ] Active-slice acceptance criteria pass.
- [ ] Pairing security and cross-workspace isolation tests pass.
- [ ] Worker and repository integration tests pass on the approved macOS versions.
- [ ] Source-upload, prohibited-onboarding-data, first-confirmation, and metadata-minimization checks pass.
- [ ] Accountless data-loss scenarios distinguish export import, repository reconnection, and new project history.
- [ ] Project naming, uniqueness, atomicity, and connection-state tests pass.
- [ ] Successful creation opens the new project's dashboard with the required repository, storage, and connection state.
- [ ] Required browser scenarios pass.
- [ ] The coordinated first-release browser scenarios prove that both primary entry actions are available and complete.
- [ ] GDPR data contract and privacy review for device metadata and credentials are complete.
- [ ] Build, formatting, lint, static checks, and logs review pass.

## Blocked Decisions

- Technical design: Define the exact minimum connection and compatibility fields and internal identifiers within the approved outbound-data boundary.
- Technical design: Select supported macOS versions, packaging, update, and signing mechanisms.
- Technical design: Select the pairing protocol, credential lifecycle, outbound transport, replacement pairing, and revocation behavior.
- Technical design: Define canonical local repository identity across clones, worktrees, moved paths, changed remotes, and replacement workers.
- Technical design: Approve integration boundaries with project storage selection and hosted passwordless access.
- Required verification: Select the application-to-worker test strategy and canonical commands.
- Active-slice implementation: Approve the GDPR data contract, retention, processor, transfer, rights, and review decisions for outbound metadata and pairing credentials.

## Progress Log

### 2026-07-23 - Extracted from project onboarding

- Completed: Isolated the accepted local-repository, accountless-device, worker-pairing, source-locality, and connection-state behavior.
- Remaining: Resolve worker architecture, repository identity, metadata, privacy, integration, and verification decisions.
- Failed checks: None; implementation has not started.
- Spec updates: Created a focused local onboarding specification without changing accepted product behavior.

### 2026-07-24 - Local setup and recovery checkpoint

- Completed: Approved the local-onboarding product requirements, including macOS scope, native folder selection, explicit connection recovery, first-connection privacy disclosure, export-only project-history recovery, and stable-identity combined-catalog behavior.
- Remaining: Resolve the classified metadata-contract, technical, privacy, and verification blockers before implementation can start.
- Failed checks: None; implementation has not started.
- Spec updates: Product requirements moved from `Draft` to `Approved`; tasks remain `Blocked` at technical design and implementation readiness.
